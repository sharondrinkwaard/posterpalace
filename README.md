# Poster Palace

Welcome to Poster Palace, the place where you can buy digital posters and pictures. For everyone looking to 'cheer up' their wall, this is your place. 

MOCKUP PICTURE

## Features
Below you can find all features that are included in this project.

### Favicon
I generated a Favicon with the logo of Poster Palace on [WebsitePlanet](https://www.websiteplanet.com/nl/webtools/favicon-generator/)

SCREENSHOT

### Navigation Bar
The navigation bar starts with a logo on the left (on mobile on the right), followed by Posters, about, login, register and the shoppingcart. When logged in, the 'Login' and 'Register' change to 'My Orders' and 'Logout' 
The 'Posters' is a dropdown menu which displays all categories. The 'About' is a dropdown as well and displays the Terms, cookies and contact. 

### Categories
---
There are currently 4 categories named Nature, Architecture, People and Artistic. All posters are linked to one category. 
## Products
The products being sold on this website are digital posters. I loaded them in using fixtures in the Posters app. 
With some help of ChatGPT Plus I generated these fixtures including images from [Pexels](https://pexels.com). 
To clarify; I created the fixtures myself and let Chat GPT add extra items to this. I chose to do this so I could experience what a tool like this is capable of. 
All posters have a name, description, price, sku, rating, image + image url and category asigned to it.

All products are sorted by categories. There are four categories named 'Architecture', 'Nature', 'People' which includes portraits and 'Artistic' which included art and graphics. The last one also includes a few posters that are generated by AI. 

### About Us
A bit of information about Poster Palace

### Contact
A contact form which enables users to contact Poster Palace.

### Terms & Conditions
Some Terms & Conditions and Cookies because these are nesseccary and obligatory for a webshop.

### Footer
A footer with links to extra information, social media buttons and a newsletter sign up form. 

### Payment System

THe payment system I am currently using is Stripe. I used the code like in the Boutique Ado walkthrough as it was quite complicated. 

## Features left to implement
- <strong>Watermark</strong> The images need a watermark
- <strong>Identation.</strong> I played around with different identation tabs. 4 and 2. This is why some pages of html are in 4 tabs and others in 2. I am going to set these to the same value of tabs which will be 2.
- <strong>Grammar and spelling. </strong> As English is my second language, there might be some grammar or spelling mistakes. I want to correct these in the future.
- <strong>Filtering and sorting.</strong> I want the user to be able to sort and filter the products not only by category as is right now. But also by price and name. 
- <strong>Pinterest.</strong >I want to add a Pinterest link to the Pinterest account (not signed up yet).
- <strong>Design. </strong> I'm not content about the design of this project. Due to a time limit I decided to not put too much time in it and focus on the technical side first.
- <strong>Unsolved bugs.</strong> I want to fix all unsolved bugs.
- <strong>Newsletter</strong>
- <strong>Category for AI.</strong> Eventually I want to add an extra (sub) category for posters that are generated by AI. Currently they are under the 'Artistic' category as the images are all related to art. 
- <strong>Description for AI.</strong> The images that are generated by AI need to have a description which mentions that the posters are generated by AI. So far this is not mentioned. 
- <strong>Shoppingcart on mobile.</strong> On a mobile device the shoppingcart is hidden in the collapsable menu. This needs to be positioned next to the logo, outside of the collapsable menu, so that the cart is very accessable. 

## Design
---
- I used Balsamiq to create a first picture of what this project would look like.
- On [Coolors](https://coolors.co/) I created a colour pallete so I know what colours match and look nice together. The colours I used are:
    - #f3c063 for the buttons

### Wireframes
The wireframes are very basic and only display the nesseccary features.

## Libraries & Installations
---
- Django Allauth
- Summernote 
- Pillow
- Crispy forms
- Flask
- Stripe Payments

## Agile
---
When planning this project, I started writing the epics first. Then I broke them down into user stories. For this I have created an Excel sheet and a kanban board. I prefered the Excel sheet because for me it created and clearer overview than the kanban board.

For this portfolio project the estimated time is 6 weeks, 50 hours a week.
For the total project (including the features left to implement) I am estimating 12 weeks

- LINK TO KANBAN BOARD
- SCREENSHOT OF EXCEL SHEET

## SEO
- I added Meta tags to add keywords and a description
- Lighthouse report
- I used Semantic Code like a header, h1 and h2 on every page in the correct order, several sections, footer etc.
- I did research on what would be correct keywords to use
- Alt attributes
- Account on Facebook and Instagram and will use Pinterest in the future as well.
- Email newsletter
- 
## Testing

## Bugs
Below you can find a description of bugs I ran into while making this project. 
### Solved Bugs
- Copying the allauth templates into my own directory. 
Using the commands in the terminal like in the videos didn't work. So I tried installing django allath again. Now the terminal displayed 'Requirement already satisfied' with the correct path of where allauth was installed. Using this helped me copy all those files into my own directory.
'''
    cp -r /usr/local/python/3.10.13/lib/python3.10/site-packages/allauth/templates* ./templates/allauth/
'''

- Currently when typing 
''' pip3 freeze > requirements.txt ''' 
in the terminal, it did result in an empty file. Previously this file was filled with all the dependencies, but now it is empty. 
The problem was not in the terminal,  but that I created a new workspace on Gitpod so I could use the PRO version provided by Code Institute. I didn't know that I had to install all requirements again, so I did using:
''' pip install -r requirements.txt ''' 

### Unsolved Bugs
- AWS bucket issue. Staticfiles were not uploading to the bucket. Due to some spelling mistakes like 'acces' instead of  'access' and naming the bucket policy instead of the bucket name itself, it was not working. When I changed those, the staticfiles where working. 
Only the image links were incorrect, but that is another issue.

Welcome sharondrinkwaard,

This is the Code Institute student template for Gitpod. We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started. It's perfectly ok to use this template as the basis for your project submissions.

You can safely delete this README.md file, or change it for your own project. Please do read it at least once, though! It contains some important information about Gitpod and the extensions we use. Some of this information has been updated since the video content was created. The last update to this file was: **September 1, 2021**

## Gitpod Reminders

To run a frontend (HTML, CSS, Javascript only) application in Gitpod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

To run a backend Python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your Python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: _Make Public_,

Another blue button should appear to click: _Open Browser_.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the lessons.

To log into the Heroku toolbelt CLI:

1. Log in to your Heroku account and go to *Account Settings* in the menu under your avatar.
2. Scroll down to the *API Key* and click *Reveal*
3. Copy the key
4. In Gitpod, from the terminal, run `heroku_config`
5. Paste in your API key when asked

You can now use the `heroku` CLI program - try running `heroku apps` to confirm it works. This API key is unique and private to you so do not share it. If you accidentally make it public then you can create a new one with _Regenerate API Key_.

## Release History

We continually tweak and adjust this template to help give you the best experience. Here is the version history:

**September 20 2023:** Update Python version to 3.9.17.

**September 1 2021:** Remove `PGHOSTADDR` environment variable.

**July 19 2021:** Remove `font_fix` script now that the terminal font issue is fixed.

**July 2 2021:** Remove extensions that are not available in Open VSX.

**June 30 2021:** Combined the P4 and P5 templates into one file, added the uptime script. See the FAQ at the end of this file.

**June 10 2021:** Added: `font_fix` script and alias to fix the Terminal font issue

**May 10 2021:** Added `heroku_config` script to allow Heroku API key to be stored as an environment variable.

**April 7 2021:** Upgraded the template for VS Code instead of Theia.

**October 21 2020:** Versions of the HTMLHint, Prettier, Bootstrap4 CDN and Auto Close extensions updated. The Python extension needs to stay the same version for now.

**October 08 2020:** Additional large Gitpod files (`core.mongo*` and `core.python*`) are now hidden in the Explorer, and have been added to the `.gitignore` by default.

**September 22 2020:** Gitpod occasionally creates large `core.Microsoft` files. These are now hidden in the Explorer. A `.gitignore` file has been created to make sure these files will not be committed, along with other common files.

**April 16 2020:** The template now automatically installs MySQL instead of relying on the Gitpod MySQL image. The message about a Python linter not being installed has been dealt with, and the set-up files are now hidden in the Gitpod file explorer.

**April 13 2020:** Added the _Prettier_ code beautifier extension instead of the code formatter built-in to Gitpod.

**February 2020:** The initialisation files now _do not_ auto-delete. They will remain in your project. You can safely ignore them. They just make sure that your workspace is configured correctly each time you open it. It will also prevent the Gitpod configuration popup from appearing.

**December 2019:** Added Eventyret's Bootstrap 4 extension. Type `!bscdn` in a HTML file to add the Bootstrap boilerplate. Check out the <a href="https://github.com/Eventyret/vscode-bcdn" target="_blank">README.md file at the official repo</a> for more options.

## FAQ about the uptime script

**Why have you added this script?**

It will help us to calculate how many running workspaces there are at any one time, which greatly helps us with cost and capacity planning. It will help us decide on the future direction of our cloud-based IDE strategy.

**How will this affect me?**

For everyday usage of Gitpod, it doesn’t have any effect at all. The script only captures the following data:

- An ID that is randomly generated each time the workspace is started.
- The current date and time
- The workspace status of “started” or “running”, which is sent every 5 minutes.

It is not possible for us or anyone else to trace the random ID back to an individual, and no personal data is being captured. It will not slow down the workspace or affect your work.

**So….?**

We want to tell you this so that we are being completely transparent about the data we collect and what we do with it.

**Can I opt out?**

Yes, you can. Since no personally identifiable information is being captured, we'd appreciate it if you let the script run; however if you are unhappy with the idea, simply run the following commands from the terminal window after creating the workspace, and this will remove the uptime script:

```
pkill uptime.sh
rm .vscode/uptime.sh
```

**Anything more?**

Yes! We'd strongly encourage you to look at the source code of the `uptime.sh` file so that you know what it's doing. As future software developers, it will be great practice to see how these shell scripts work.

Happy coding!
